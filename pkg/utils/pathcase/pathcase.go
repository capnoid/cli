// `myentrypoint.js` even if the file is named `myEntrypoint.js`, but when we tar and ship this
// to an ext4 (Linux) FS, we error when trying to open `myentrypoint.js` (it's case-sensitive on
// ext4 and `myentrypoint.js` does not exist.)
// Note this only fixes the file part of the path - directories in the path are returned as is,
// even if their casing is incorrect. Further work would be needed to support recursively fixing
// all parent directories.
